# IK-RobotArm
OpenGL robotic arm controlled with Inverse Kinematics using Dual-Quaternions.

This project it's being done with https://github.com/Schmurst, and with https://github.com/sokol_murturi112 as our second assignment for the MATHEMATICS AND GRAPHICS module of the MSc in Computer Games & Entertainment at Goldsmiths, University of London.

This project it's being developed for OCTET Framework, using C++ with OpenGL. This is an educational project, but it can be easily exported and used for other purposes.


How to use this 'game':

  - Mouse click -> The arm will go to the position clicked by the mouse.
  - Arrow keys -> To move the arm along the 'bar'
  - Ctrl+Arrow keys -> Teleports the arm to the middle position of each side of the table.
  - Spacebar -> Throw a magnetic charge
  - A -> Move the arm to a random position
  - S -> Activate the closest-neighbour algorithm to a random position
  - D -> Activate party-mode.
  - R -> Move the arm to the top.
  - O -> Throw the balls again (to play again!)
  - Q -> Stops the current movement!
  - 1 -> Rotates the camera to the left
  - 2 -> Rotates the camera to the right
  - 3 -> Toggles top-view and side-view
